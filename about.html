                <h2>Russ Cooper</h2>
                <p>Russ Cooper is a visionary entrepreneur, investor, and outspoken advocate for workplace safety and
                    economic justice. His journey began not in the boardrooms of Silicon Valley, but in the very
                    trenches of the modern workforce, where he experienced firsthand the challenges faced by everyday
                    employees. A workplace injury early in his career gave Russ an unshakable belief in the right to
                    fair compensation and the power of innovative disruption. A hard worker with a keen eye for identifying
                    inefficiencies in outdated systems, he attacked his employer through the legal system. His
                    record-breaking workplace lawsuit has championed workers rights and made him the first billionaire
                    through a class-action lawsuit.</p>
                <br>
                <p> A devoted family man and hard worker, Russ credits his resilience and vision to his upbringing, where he was taught
                    the value of perseverance and standing up for what is right. Today, he channels that same energy
                    into investing in companies that challenge the status quo. Whether through cutting-edge advancements
                    in AI automation or his relentless push for transparency in data security, Russ continues to
                    redefine what it means to be a leader in the digital age—proving that true success isn’t measured by
                    where you start, but by the impact you make.</p>
